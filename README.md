# Money

A web app to track my funds.

## Introduction

This will be a server and client for a fund tracking web app. The server will be
written in go. The client is just html + css + [js].

## Goals

* Go server that will serve pages
* Storage will be persistant even if server shutsdown
	- Use some sort of SQL database
	- SQLite is likely candidate
* Client should have a clean simple UI
	- If its not simple I probably won't use it.
	- Consider adding mobile support
